## Changing File Ownership
Learnt about permissions of file and how we can view them by using ls -l.<br>
learnt about that the first letter of the format means the type i.e. directory or file. Directory - `d` , file - `-`.<br>
Learnt about the 9 letters which tell us abou the permissions of user, group and other users.<br>
This challenge was fairly simple i had to change the permission of the `/flag` file to hacker user by using the `chown` command which can only be accessed by the root user but for this challenge i was able to use it to change the permission and then read the flag.<br>
```bash
hacker@permissions~changing-file-ownership:~$ ls -l
total 36
-rw-r--r-- 1 hacker hacker   4 Oct  8 17:41 COLLEGE

```
## Groups and Files
Learnt about how members of groups can access the files accessible to that group.<br>
used the chgrp command to change the group of the flag and then read it to obtain the flag.<br>
```bash
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ id
uid=1000(hacker) gid=1000(hacker) groups=1000(hacker)
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ ls -l
total 36

hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{wUTbcNNGhbezEeRYTC4JCjpDoH3.dFzNyUDLzYTN0czW}
```
## Fun With Groups Names
This time my user group was named something different than hacker so i used the id command to get the group name and then used `chgrp` to change the permission of `/flag` to my new group name to read it.<br>
```bash
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ id
uid=1000(hacker) gid=1000(grp32761) groups=1000(grp32761)
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ ls -l
total 36
-rw-r--r-- 1 hacker grp32761   4 Oct  8 17:41 COLLEGE

hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ chgrp grp32761 flag

hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{k275-xyYGyEafVwXbcC8M4midy6.dJzNyUDLzYTN0czW}
```
## Changing Permission
We can also change the access level of files by using the `chmod` command.<br>
to add we use `u` `g` `o` for user group and other user, to add read write execute, we can use ugo+-rwx and make all possible combinations you want.<br>
The format is `chmod permission file`.<br>
```bash
hacker@permissions~changing-permissions:~$ ls -l
total 36
---------- 1 hacker hacker   4 Oct  8 17:41 COLLEGE
---------- 1 hacker hacker   8 Oct  9 07:28 PWN

hacker@permissions~changing-permissions:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{Y_32trqVVm9GXcGCCRDMO8PX9xI.dNzNyUDLzYTN0czW}
```
## Executable Files
Similar to the previous ones just now had to change the executing permission whereas before i was changing the read permisssion.<br>
```bash
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ ls -l /challenge/
total 32
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root   root    1222 Jul  4 06:38 DESCRIPTION.md
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root   root   16864 Feb  8  2024 getflag
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root   root     211 Feb  8  2024 getflag.c
-r--r--r-x 1 hacker hacker    32 Jul  4 06:37 run
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ chmod u+x /challenge/run
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ /challenge/run
Successful execution! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4_rba5a5zNPF8jshRxEGxky9pTS.dJTM2QDLzYTN0czW}
```
## Permission Tweaking Practice
This challenge had nothing new but was a good practice of the chmod command.<br>
I had to change the file permission 8 times consecutively and at the end change tha flag to make it readable.<br>
```bash
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ /challenge/run

## The SUID Bit
some programs need admin access which cant be available all the time, so the SUID command can give the user access as the files owner.<br>
this access access can be given by chmod command by doing `u+s`.<br>
```bash
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$ chmod u+s /challenge/getroot
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$ /challenge/getroot
SUCCESS! You have set the suid bit on this program, and it is running as root!
Here is your shell...
root@permissions~the-suid-bit:~# cat /flag
pwn.college{MtoYplFVlZFoqlEkm0dFiTw9tGv.dNTM2QDLzYTN0czW}
```
