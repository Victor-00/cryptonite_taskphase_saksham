## The Root
The description of the challenge told that the path of a file or folder starting from root directory to that file or folder is called the absolute path. The challenge asked to run 'pwn' from absolute path so i did that to get the flag.

The commands :-

` hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn 
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{s4v0hQFNVRd-pMLQUxhNByBEz5D.dhzN5QDLwIjN0czW} `
