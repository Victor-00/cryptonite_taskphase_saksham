## The Root
The description of the challenge told that the path of a file or folder starting from root directory to that file or folder is called the absolute path. The challenge asked to run 'pwn' from absolute path so i did that to get the flag.

The commands :-<br/>
` hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn `<br/> 
` BOOM!!! `<br/>
` Here is your flag: `<br/>
` pwn.college{s4v0hQFNVRd-pMLQUxhNByBEz5D.dhzN5QDLwIjN0czW} `

## Program and absolute paths
This challenge is exact same as the last one except here we have to run 'run' which whose absolute path is '/challenge/run' , so after running it from the absolute path i got the flag.

The commands :- <br/>
`hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run`<br/>
`Correct!!!`<br/>
`/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:`<br/>
`pwn.college{kQhdP3Z8F0HPOKr-RY_5b7VbtvQ.dVDN1QDLwIjN0czW}`<br/>
