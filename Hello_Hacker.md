# Intro to Commands

I used the ssh command in my terminal to ssh in the pwn college challenge and type the command 'hello' as it was clearly mentioned in the instructions that i need to invoke 'hello' command to get the flag.
After typing 'hello' command the terminal gave the flag.

# Intro to Arguments

The description asked to invoke the command 'hello' with the argument 'hackers' so i typed hello hackers in the terminal after SSHing and that gave me the flag.
