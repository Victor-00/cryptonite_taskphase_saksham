### Challenge 1: Matching with *
Here, we learn about the first glob, ie, ~ * ~. 
The shell treats it as a wildcard and tries to replace the argument with any files that match the pattern.
We should note that ` * ` matches any part of the filename except for __'/'__ or a leading __'.'__ character.

```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /ch*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{oND-4SOnnXD0EYDd0mgF4NRAs4t.dFjM4QDL1IzN0czW}

```

### Challenge 2: Matching with ?
Here, we learn about the second glob, ie, ~ ? ~.
the shell will treat it as single-character wildcard. 
This works like ` * `, but only matches one character.

```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{seC6fdbux3XOWnGLrZGLbwiMrZj.dJjM4QDL1IzN0czW}

```

### Challenge 3: Matching with []
Here, we learn about the next glob, ie, ~ [] ~.
The square brackes are, essentially, a limited form of ? 
In that instead of matching any character, [] is a wildcard for some subset of potential characters, specified within the brackets.
In this challenge, we need to change our working directory to `/challenge/files` and run `/challenge/run` with a single argument that globs into 3 other files

```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run file_[absh]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{0zu6ZXu97WXKhUVYBwlhROaoY92.dNjM4QDL1IzN0czW}

```

### Challenge 4: Matching paths with []
This challenge is similar to the previous challenge, however, here we need to file glob the absolute path.

```
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[bash]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{0_D9jB6N7jt0Khmq7e-s0jq-zhn.dRjM4QDL1IzN0czW}

```

### Challenge 5: Mixing globs.
This challegne is a combination of all the previous challenges in this module. Here we need to __cd__ to `/challenge/files`.
Further we need to use our prior learned knowledge to match 3 given files using 6 chars or less.

```
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [cep]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{Umx2HOzepZmmPCyKmGOMrw3iVoh.dVjM4QDL1IzN0czW}

```

### Challenge 6: Exclusionary Globbing 
Here, we are introduced to ~ ! ~ and ` ^ ` commands within the ` [] ` glob. 
They work as inversions, that is exclude search for all characters mentioned within the brackets.
This challenge is also a combination of the previous challenges.

```
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [!pwn]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{s0UGVOWMuvUR0I2me-QbDYvkc39.dZjM4QDL1IzN0czW}

```
